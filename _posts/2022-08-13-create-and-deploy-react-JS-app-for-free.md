# Introduction

You probably want to create your own ReactJS application, and host it somewhere on a cloud-based solution afterwards. Depending on your final goals, there are a lot of app-hosting platforms like **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/){:target="_blank"}**, **[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/){:target="_blank"}**, **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/){:target="_blank"}** and so on. But today, let me prove you that **[Gitlab](https://Gitlab.com/){:target="_blank"} is** also **a great React JS app hosting platform**.

# What is a react JS app ?
A react JS app is a **[user-friendly](#1-user-friendly)** **[web-based](#2-web-based)** application where everything is pretty much **[fast to load](#3-fast-to-load)**.

## 1. User-friendly
It doesn't matter the device, the resolution, the browser, or even the internet provider : the inner app features will always work properly, even if [it may not look the same](http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/){:target="_blank"}.

## 2. Web-based
React framework renders HTML **components**, using Javascript. The final outputs are **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS** files. The main advantage is that a react JS app is a [Progressive Web App](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application){:target="_blank"} (PWA) that is installable as a native app, just by adding it at user's home screen.


## 3. Fast to load
A react JS app **only re-renders relevant components** on each user's actions, instead of reloading the whole html document like a basic webpage.

# The hosting solution
As stated at the [introduction](#introduction), we will use **Gitlab** as our web-hosting solution. You can check out what Gitlab is and why I have chosen it in my [Github vs Gitlab article](/why-Gitlab-is-sometimes-better-than-Github){:target="_blank"}.

Basically, we will use Gitlab to **handle 3 processes** :
1. [store our code](#6-push-files-to-Gitlab)
2. [deploy our app to Gitlab pages](#4-create-Gitlab-ciyml-file-for-cdci)
3. [host our web-app endlessly](#7-checkout-pipelines-and-jobs)


# What you will need
This article assumes that :
- You already have a [Gitlab account][Gitlab account]{:target="_blank"} 
- You are familiar to creating and developping a [React JS app][React JS app]{:target="_blank"}

And that's it !


# Steps
## 1. Create Gitlab repo
(work in progress)

## 2. Clone the repo to your local machine
(work in progress)

> To link your local machine to your Gitlab account, check out this [dedicated article](/how-to-create-access-token-to-push-files-to-Github-or-Gitlab){:target="_blank"}

## 3. Build locally (very important)
(work in progress)

## 4. Create .gitlab-ci.yml file for CD/CI (very important)
(work in progress)

## 5. Change .gitignore file (very important)
(work in progress)

## 6. Push files to Gitlab
(work in progress)

## 7. Checkout pipelines and jobs
(work in progress)
