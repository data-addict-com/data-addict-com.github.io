# Welcome to Data Addict repo.
Hey, thanks for visiting this repo!
It's basically my website content, that you definitely can clone to make it your own blogging CMS.

# Credits
I'm a data engineer and I actually don't build websites. All the front end elements here are from [jekyll-klise](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise).

# How to use this repo
The template I mentionned before might help you, but here are some tips:
`_posts` : where your articles will be stored, with a specific filename to make the datetimes work.
`assets` : for images, css style, and favicons.
`_sass/main.scss` : for generic parameters such as colors, font-family, size of few elements, etc.
`_includes` : for the templates that will be used to render your contents.
