Hey, thanks for visiting this repo!

It's basically my website content, that you definitely can clone/[fork](https://github.com/jadynekena/jadynekena.github.io/fork)/[use as a template](https://github.com/jadynekena/jadynekena.github.io/generate) to make it your own blogging CMS.

# How to use this repo
Here are some tips to get started :  
- `_config.yml` : for the main configuration of your website. You can see the [beautiful-jekyll config](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/blob/master/_config.yml) to understand how to fill it with your own datas.
- `_posts` : where your articles will be stored, with a specific filename to make the datetimes work.  
- `assets` : for images, css style, and favicons.  
- `_sass/main.scss` : for generic parameters such as colors, font-family, size of few elements, etc.  
- `_includes` : for the templates that will be used to render your website : navbar, posts contents, and even comments section.
